# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Creating a game of rock paper scissors as part of the Odin Project funadmentals course. I will be using javascript to program my game.

The user will play rock paper scissors against the computer in a series of rounds. All games are played in the console, eventually moving to an interactive Rock Paper Scissors website.
