# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Creating a game of rock paper scissors as part of the Odin Project funadmentals course. I will be using javascript to program my game.

The user will play rock paper scissors against the computer in a series of rounds. All games are played in the console, eventually moving to an interactive Rock Paper Scissors website.

Required functions:

computerPlay: randomly returns "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors"

use random number, assign string based on number. 
    2-4 incl rock
    5-7 incl paper
    8-10 incl scissors
    

function2: plays one round of rock paper scissors. Requires two parameters - computerSelection and playerSelection (TOP names it playRound)

For basic game:

Computer selects first. Prompt asks for user imput. This should be case-insensitive.

Compare computer selection with player selection.
